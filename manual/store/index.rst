Introduction

The Store module helps to integrate a virtual store where the players will 
can purchase items with virtual currency or virtual resources. 
Additionally, you can monetize the game by adding IAP (In App Purchase) 
products, in coordinance with App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android).

You create the products in Admin Tools and consume them in Unity through 
Brainztorm SDK that provides you with facilities to construct the Store 
within the game scene.
