Introduction

Brainztorm's communications component eases communication with backend servers and frees the 
developer from many important concerns such as: security, integrity, performance, data serialization, 
and more. It also gives you the power to configure client and server settings so you can 
adjust parameters to addapt it to the game's specific needs.
