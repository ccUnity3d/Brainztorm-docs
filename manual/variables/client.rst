Client Variables
================

Intro
-----
The variables module eases the way to handle data stored on server. Allows you to create custom entities and sync them with
backend collections instantly.

<intro>

You might need to create a set of units with different stats, keep track of the players characters and more. You could do so
storing the data on a secure server rather than in local storage, which could be easily breached and exploited through many 
already available tools.

How to use
----------
The variables module is one of brainztorm's core features, so it will be enabled by default. To start using you first need to define entities using the `Entity Manager`_.
