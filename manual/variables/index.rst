Introduction
************
The variables module eases the way to handle data stored on server. Allows you to 
create custom entities and sync them with backend collections instantly.

You might need to create a set of units with different stats, keep track of the 
players characters and more. You could do so storing the data on a secure server 
rather than in local storage, which could be easily breached and exploited through 
many already available tools.
